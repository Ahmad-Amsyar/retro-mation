Quote: The baggier my pant is, the happier my life will be.

Intro: Creative thinker by day, caffeine enthusiast by... also day. I’m a graphic designer, Warframe grinder and etc, who blends sharp strategy with just the right amount of weird. I believe in big ideas, clean execution, and the occasional pun. Whether I’m solving problems or making spreadsheets a little too colorful, I bring energy, curiosity, and a can-do attitude (plus snacks).
