introduction: |
  Iâ€™m Es and I love to create. Aside from the flipbooks I used to make in primary school, I started digital art by designing album covers for my Spotify releases. As someone who loves expressing himself, animation and digital art have become another outlet for me to share my ideas with others. I hope to be able to do it forever.

synopsis: |
  In the cyberpunk city of Nu-Santara, two neo-exorcists, Bulan and Suria, cleanse the streets of malevolent spirits. When a powerful entity threatens to possess one of them, the duo must rely on their bond to banish it and save their own souls.
details:
  runtime: "3 minutes 30 seconds"
  genre: "Sci-Fi, Action, Supernatural"
directors_statement: "As someone who has loved sci-fi and mystical elements my whole life, I wanted to create a story that implemented those genres within a local setting. I made it a point to give my characters Malay names as well as having the dialogue in Malay. I wanted to explore what a world that intertwined superstition with technology would look like and that is how I ended up with my animation."
