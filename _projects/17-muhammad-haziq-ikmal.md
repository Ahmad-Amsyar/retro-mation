introduction: |
  Hello, my name is Haziq. Apparently, I'm in my final semester, but still figuring out what I truly want to do. I do regret choosing animation course that doesn’t have a definite answer for every subject because the marks given by lecturer and someone else taste not based on my own study from books at all. I hope to find something I love and pursue it with passion.

synopsis: |
  The Broken Seal about Lynna, a young girl who finds an old doll and accidentally breaks a strange talisman in her attic. That night, the doll comes to life, revealing itself as a vengeful spirit. It haunts Lynna, feeding on her grief and fears.
  
  Terrified and alone, Lynna must face the doll and the darkness inside herself. As the haunting grows stronger, she finds the courage to fight back. In the end, she overcomes the spirit, regaining her strength and peace.
details:
  runtime: "3-5 minutes"
  genre: "Drama/ Horror"
directors_statement: "The Broken Seal is a reminder that it’s okay to pause. To feel. To face the fears you’ve been ignoring and that doing so isn’t weakness, it’s strength. Through Lynna’s journey, the animation becomes more than entertainment; it becomes a visual metaphor for the emotional battles we fight when no one’s watching."
