synopsis: |
  On an unknown prison island, Sam sits in total silence. Agitated with an unstoppable urge that he can’t help to satisfy, he can’t relieve himself. His frustration grew when an unresponsive cellmate brought to his room, disturbing the already tense condition. Desperate to elevate the situation, he tried initiating conversation, leading him to reveal a disquieting memory that caused him to be imprisoned: standing beside a dead girl with bloodied knife, with blurred memories of what happened.
  
  With the cellmate's silence continued, emotion intensified, Sam's grasp of reality started to slip. With the manifestation of a quiet prisoner, it begins to stir something deeper—guilt, fear and perhaps denial. What started as a desperate search for relief slowly turns into a mental standoff, as Sam confronts both the stranger and the darker truths he’s tried to bury.

directors_statement: "I never really thought of the inspiration behind the story, it just dawned on me one night. but if i tried to pinpoint stories that maybe influenced this story, I’m gonna say Oldboy (Korean Version) and Fight Club. I like the twist and turns of these movies as well as the characters in them."
