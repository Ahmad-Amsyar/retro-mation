  Intrigued by his grandfather's story of a mysterious guardian haunting the misty waters of Lake Kenyir, Adam, a curious teenager, sets out to uncover the truth. Armed with his grandfather's stories and a radio for safety, he paddles alone into the lake, shrouded in thick fog. His search turns cold when he meets Raja, a hornbill with piercing eyes, who seems to guide him deeper into the mist. A few disturbing things happen after Adam encounters Raja, which almost takes Adam's life.
