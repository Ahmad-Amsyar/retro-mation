synopsis: |
  While exploring the wilderness, Ethan stumbles upon a hidden passage that leads him to a breathtaking underground magical lake. Weary, hungry, and parched, he reaches down to drink from its shimmering waters only to be interrupted by Nia, a mysterious and enchanting creature who dwells within the lake. What begins as a search for survival soon becomes a journey of trust, magic, and destiny.
details:
  runtime: "3-5 minutes"
  genre: "Dark Fantasy, Thriller, Adventure"
directors_statement: "The story is inspired by the circle of life, where predators hunt prey. But it also explores what happens when predators confront other predators turning each encounter into a battle for survival or a desperate fight against hunger. In many ways, it mirrors the human world. Just as animals clash for dominance and survival, people battle each other in a relentless struggle for success. Our societyâ€™s competition is nothing less than a civilized version of predator versus predator."
