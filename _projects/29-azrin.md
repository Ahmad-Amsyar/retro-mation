  An angel, on her final mission before retirement, is tasked with finding a home for Oyen, an orange cat residing in a quiet adoption center. Oyen, a creature of habit, has grown accustomed to the solitude and fleeting human attention. However, with the angel's subtle intervention, a young woman seeking a companion is drawn to Oyen, reminded of a beloved past pet. A connection forms, and Oyen finally finds her forever home, allowing the angel to retire peacefully.
