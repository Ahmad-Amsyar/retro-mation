  Creative thinker by day, caffeine enthusiast by... also day. I’m a graphic designer, Warframe grinder and etc, who blends sharp strategy with just the right amount of weird. I believe in big ideas, clean execution, and the occasional pun. Whether I’m solving problems or making spreadsheets a little too colorful, I bring energy, curiosity, and a can-do attitude (plus snacks).

directors_statement: "Actually the story idea come from a tiktok story of a deceased senior citizen and his cat. Even Though the deceased has been bury, but the cat still walking around the grave and stay for a few minutes. Even, the daughter of the deceased tries to pull away the cat from the grave but it insists to stay and lingering around the his fav owner grave. From there, i wonder if the deceased feels sorrowful to see his pet still lingering around his grave thus, from there i get an idea for my story."
