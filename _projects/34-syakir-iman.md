synopsis: |
  Jake, an honest small-town mechanic, discovers a bag of white powder in a mysterious car dropped at his garage. Moments later, the police surround him. Panicked, Jake flees in the vehicle, leading to a high-speed chase. It ends in a violent crash, leaving Jake to face the devastating cost of one desperate decision.

details:
  runtime: "3-5 minutes"
  genre: "Crime thriller"
directors_statement: "I created this story to highlight the hidden dangers of blindly accepting every opportunity, especially when driven by desperation or the lure of easy money. Through Jakeâ€™s journey, I wanted to show how a single moment of misplaced trust or panic can unravel a life built on honesty. This story is a cautionary tale about the consequences of greed and the importance of staying true to one's values, even when faced with uncertainty."
