introduction: |
  As an introverted artist, I find beauty in forgotten places and quiet emotions. I'm in too many fandoms to list, but Blue Period is close to my heart. I create art to express what words can't. I'm always learning, and I hope my work resonates with others someday.

synopsis: |
  In a distant world beyond ours, a star-born child named Himmel falls from the sky and awakens in a forgotten corner of Earth. With a heart bound to nature, Himmel becomes a kindred spirit to the forest’s creatures—until the calm is shattered. An ancient manta, Caelara, a celestial being from the same skies, crashes into a man-made structure, unleashing a haunting cry that echoes through the trees. Sensing a deep unrest, Himmel embarks on a journey to find the source of the voice. But will the light arrive in time—before the last star fades?

  runtime: "3-5 minutes"

directors_statement: "I have been playing Sky games for almost 4 years, which is the first obvious reason I developed this animation. I always considered how I wanted to deliver an animation that would take viewers to a different world and possibly provide viewers with a brief moment of escape from reality."
