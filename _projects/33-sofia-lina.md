introduction: |
  I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m a student working through deadlines. Some days I feel like I’m making progress, others I’m just exhausted. But I keep drawing, animating, and moving forward, even if I don’t always know where I’m headed. Maybe that’s just what growth looks like.

directors_statement: "The Visitor grew from a simple “what if” moment what if a small, curious encounter in the woods became something no one expected? I wanted to capture that jolt when the familiar turns strange, and how even the bravest of us can feel disoriented by fear."

This is additional content for Student 1's project, written in Markdown.
It will be processed by `{{ content }}` in the `project_detail.html` layout if you put a `{{ content }}` tag there (currently it's not).
If you want this, add `{{ content }}` inside the `project_detail.html` layout, perhaps at the end of the `<div class="lg:col-span-2">` section.
