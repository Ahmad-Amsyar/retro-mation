  My name is Nornajmi Bin Nasuha, I’m just a normal guy that likes to draw in class even though I’m a science student. I like to draw backgrounds and design weapons for my character. After that I’m moving to 3D style art like modelling a scene or object in maya and blender.

synopsis: |
  This is a story about Kai, a young street racing criminal, faces a challenge from arrogant Ren, a good driver. Despite his limited experience, Kai masters a risky cornering maneuver, passing Ren at the last possible moment. This win gains Ren's respect and a growing rivalry, and serves as a turning point for Kai, teaching him the importance of fear and challenge.

directors_statement: "The reason why I made this animation is because of my love of anime car racing and 3D Modeling. Another reason is that I want to try using my 3D knowledge to make a short story based on my all time favourite old school anime such as Initial D and Ghibli old school style."
