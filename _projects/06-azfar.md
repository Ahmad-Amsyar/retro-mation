synopsis: |
  Deep within the rainforest, where myths whisper through the leaves and shadows move with purpose, a young man named Rohan finds himself at a crossroads. Desperate for money, he joins a ruthless poaching group despite knowing that every step he takes could mean harm to the forest’s fragile life. But everything changes when he encounters Mairuha, a feral girl with a mysterious connection to the jungle and its secrets. This is a tale of wild beauty and inner conflict, where the bond between man and nature becomes both a weapon and a cure.
