synopsis: |
  Emit, an artist with a creative block, despairs over her lost inspiration for a very long time. 
  
  One day, a gust of wind reveals an old drawing, and a stunning sunrise captures her attention from her bedroom window. Inspired, she steps outside and discovers a new garden, finding joy in the simple moments of life. This reflection rekindles her creativity, and she returns home with renewed purpose, ready to draw again.

  runtime: "3-5 minutes"

directors_statement: "I’ve been struggling with a creative block for several months. I keep shifting from one story idea to another, yet none of them resonate with me. I consistently feel dissatisfied with all my creations. This issue has started to impact my life and my studies. I then question myself about the reason I embarked on this journey, and that's when I finally gaze at the sky after feeling stuck for what seems like ages. It reminds me of the joy and simplicity of my childhood and the world around me. This is where the inspiration for the animation originated – to take a moment to appreciate life."
