directors_statement: "First, I want to raise awareness about deforestation through this animation and hopefully my audience will share it to other people to further amplify the effect. Furthermore, I love to showcase a bit of imagery from Sarawak since it is an enclosed state in Malaysia. In other words, i want to stop the stereotype of “Sarawakians live in tree houses” but they are the one who preserve and protect the forest. Why? According to Borneo, journal written by Rhett A. Butler in Mongabay,  70% of Sarawak consists of forests and having one of the oldest rainforests in the world which was estimated around 140 million years old. In a nutshell, this animation is my love letter to my hometown and a statement to those who loves the Earth."
